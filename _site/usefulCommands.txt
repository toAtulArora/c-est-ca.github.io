git subtree push --prefix _site origin gh-pages

bundle exec jekyll serve
bundle install

Before Updating:
Comment out the line 
baseurl:/...
in _config.yml

To update the actual website, simply copy paste the contents of _site into the c-est-ca folder (in sparkleshare)

TODO: Find a way of updating this directly through git pull;
NB. in c-est-ca there's just one branch, called master
in c-est-ca_local, there're two branches; the master and the gh-pages
I have to merge the gh-pages branch with c-est-ca's master branch.
