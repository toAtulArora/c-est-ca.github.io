A scientist must learn the language in which scientific research is being performed. To everyone else it must be explained in their mother tongue. It is with this aim that we start this journey.

## The Plan
A. India
	1. Hindi
	2. Bengali
	3. Tamil
B. Europe

## Philosophy
We believe that scientific temperament has become more important than ever in recent times. We are witnessing many backward steps from the world of equality and peace which are primarily caused due to mass manipulation, misinformation and a united lack of critical thinking. The worst part of it all is that the gifts discovered by the scientific process are themselves being used to this effect.
Delivering high-quality articles to the masses in the languages most dear to them, written by their own people, is a step towards building a world we would like to live in.
